# July 28th: Getting Started!

First, I read the long(very) guide of Anicept Vex CoreXY on the website. Tried to understand everything written and researched about all the terms mentioned. At the end I had a good enough idea about 3d-printer making.
I have decided to make my own large format 3d printer.

**Total time spent: 1h**

# July 29th: Print Head

The guide said to design the printhead first. So thats what I am doing. I am using a V6 hotend and a Titan extruder clone.

Made a mount for the fan and an air duct.
