# July 28th: Getting Started!

First, I read the long(very) guide of Anicept Vex CoreXY on the website. Tried to understand everything written and researched about all the terms mentioned. At the end I had a good enough idea about 3d-printer making.
I have decided to make my own large format 3d printer.

**Total time spent: 1h**
